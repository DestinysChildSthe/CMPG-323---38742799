### Branching

###.gitignore file 
The use of the .gitignore file is to store all the files from the each project that need to be ignored or not 
 be tracked by GitHub. So basically the .gitignore file tells GitHub which files need to ignored when each project is committed into the repository.

### Storage
It is not a good idea to store credentials and sensitive information on GitHub because it is used to store code, there is no guarantee that the information stored will only be kept in only in the specific account.
