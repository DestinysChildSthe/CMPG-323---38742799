# Project 1

This repository is Kanban project that helps plan and track my work in CMPG 323 throughout the semester and also to help obtain the neccessary skills needed in the workplace environment.

## Respository
All 5 project will each have their own repository. This is to ensure that everything is organised and to avoid confusion.


### Project and repository




#### Branching
The branching strategy that will be used for each project is Git Flow which will be using multiple branches to manage master branch. The branches in this strategy are master, development, hotfix, feature and release. Where master and development are the primary branches and hotfix, feature and release are the support branches. This strategy is selected because it is easy and has different branches for specific reasons.



##### .gitignore file 
The use of the .gitignore file is to store all the files from the each project that need to be ignored or not 
 be tracked by GitHub. So basically the .gitignore file tells GitHub which files need to ignored when each project is committed into the repository.


###### Storage
It is not a good idea to store credentials and sensitive information on GitHub because it is used to store code, there is no guarantee that the information stored will only be kept in only in the specific account.
